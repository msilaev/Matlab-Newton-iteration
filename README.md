# Matlab-Newton-iteration
Netwon iterations to solve the system of two coupled non-linear differential equations in 1D, namely the Ginzburg-Landau equation for 
the order parameter and the stationary Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the magnetization direction. 
The main file is "SolverIterFun.m" and the two functions "FunSolveLLG.m", "FunSolveGL.m" realize iteraion updates for the order parameter and 
magnetization. The script "pltFUNnew.m" produces publication-ready figure. 
The code has been written by me and used in the research project https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08862
